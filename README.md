# STM32_Fan_Control_Project
This project uses an STM32 microcontroller for a temperature and motion detection system and a servo motor controller. The detection system uses sensors to monitor temperature, motion, and light, triggering LEDs based on conditions. The servo controller adjusts angles from 0° to 180° using PWM, showcasing low-level hardware control.
